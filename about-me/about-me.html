            Hi! My name is Román, i'm a mexican student of the TecNM campus Morelia, I'm studiying mechatronics engineering about to finish the career 
            (6<sup>th</sup> semester of 9). <br>
            I like to spend my free time learning and reading about random stuff, that's how I find my newest hobbie. The mechanical keyboards ❤. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
            My first approach to programming was on 2<sup>nd</sup> semester with a subjet called "basic programming", I learned things like flow charts, pseudocode, 
            algorithms and then we started to play with Java.
            Later, on 4<sup>th</sup> semester we had a subjet called "advanced programming", had nothing of "advanced" lol. We learned how to use functions and the
            bassics of OOP. <br>
            On january 1st I started the <b><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a></b> html and css course to learn the basics of
            web development and i'm absolutely in love. I consideer myself as a good self-taught, I think that a teacher it's more like a tutor who's
            always there to help you.
